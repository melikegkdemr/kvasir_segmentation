## Kvasir Segmentation using U-Net
This project aims to develop a segmentation model to identify pathological regions in endoscopic images using the Kvasir dataset. U-Net is a deep learning-based model commonly used in medical image segmentation.

### Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a reliable segmentation model to accurately identify pathological regions in endoscopic images.
This is an important step in various applications in medical imaging such as automated diagnosis and treatment planning.

### Dataset
The Kvasir dataset used in this project contains endoscopic images used for the diagnosis of various gastrointestinal diseases.
You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahwagih/kvasir-dataset-for-classification-and-segmentation).

### Code and Model
You can find the entire project and the code required for implementing the model in this [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/melikegkdemir/kvasir-segmentation-using-u-net).
